## About the Project
SpeakAR is an Augmented Reality application that would help users improve their public speaking skills in a portable manner. Through the use of spawnable human models and built in presentation view, this will allow users to simulate talking in front of other people regardless of their location.

## Features
1. **Portability**: 
  - Users can utilize the project anywhere with their mobile device
  - Having the human models adapt to any environments the user is currently in.
2. **Audience Simulation**:
  - Spawn Models: Create virtual humans that simulate an audience on detected spawnable planes.
  - Reposition Models: Allow users to move individual models to desired locations.
  - Scaling Models: Enable resizing of the human models to fit the scene or simulate different audience distances. 
3. **Slides Presentation**:  Users can present using slides in the application in front of the models to simulate a speaking event.

## Current Status of the Project
- The project currently uses free human models from the Unity Asset Store.
- Plane detection was implemented utilizing code from the previous Hands-on outputs.
- Built in slides to aide in presentation.
- The project uses UI designs with user friendly appeal.
- Completed features are model placement, repositioning, scaling, and deleting of the human models.

## Prerequisites
- Unity v2023.X
- OpenJDK installed
- Android SDK & NDK tools installed

- Ensure your environment is well-lit.
- Generally it will take some time for proper planes to spawn.
- Check for any obstructions that might block the camera's view.
